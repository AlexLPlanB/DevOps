# ***SYS-Learning Path DevOps***


## DevOps – the practice, not Azure DevOps the Platform

   DevOps refers to the approach of merging development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) together. This collaboration improves the communication, automates processes and rises the productivity throughout the software development phase.

## IoT – What does it mean and where would you use it

IoT (Internet of Things) is a concept that envolves connecting physical devices, often everyday objects like to the internet, enabling them to collect an exchange data. These devices can communicate with each other and can connect to central systems. The goal of IoT is to create a smart and connected network that enhances efficiency and makes things 

## Bicep - Microsoft Language for Resources
Bicep is a domain-specific language (DSL) developed by Microsoft for deploying Azure resources. It is designed to simplify the creation and management of Azure resources by providing a more readable syntax compared to other ARM (Azure Resource Manager) templates.


## Azure Subscription, Resource Groups 

- ***Azure Subscription***:
An Azure subscription is a container for resources in Microsoft Azure. It provides a way to manage and organize resources and control access to Azure services.

- ***Resource Groups***:
A resource group is a container for resources deployed in Azure. It helps in organizing and managing resources, applying consistent policies, and simplifying the billing process.


## Blob – Storage Type and what to store in it 

- ***Blob Storage:***
Azure Blob Storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. It is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary data.

- ***Usage***:
The Blob Storage is suitable for storing large files, such as videos and images, Backups and other unstructured data. 


## Git – Source Control  

- ***Pull Request:***
   A Pull Request (PR) is a mechanism in Git for proposing changes from one branch to another. It allows team members to review, discuss, and collaborate on the proposed changes before merging them into the target branch.

- ***Branch:*** 
   A Branch in Git is a parallel version of the codebase, allowing developers to work on features or bug fixes independently without affecting the main code. Branches help in organizing and managing development workflows.
   
- ***Commit:***
   A Commit in Git is a snapshot of changes made to the codebase. It represents a specific point in the version history, and each commit has a unique identifier. Commits help in tracking and reverting changes when needed.


## GitHub 
GitHub is a web-based platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories. It provides features like issue tracking, pull requests, and workflows to enhance collaboration among developers.

- ***Repository:***
   A Repository in GitHub is a container for a project that houses code, documentation, and related resources. It enables version control and collaboration among team members.

- ***Action:*** 
   GitHub Actions are automated workflows triggered by events in a GitHub repository. They enable continuous integration and deployment, allowing developers to automate tasks such as building, testing, and deploying code.

- ***Service Principal – Azure Deployment:***
   A Service Principal in Azure is a security identity used by applications, services, and automation tools to access Azure resources. It provides a secure way for deployments and automation to interact with Azure services without needing to expose user credentials.
